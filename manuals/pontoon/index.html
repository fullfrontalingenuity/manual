        <h2>Pontoon (if rented)</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've opted to rent pontoon boat, keys will be waiting for you on a hook near laundry.
      </p>
      <p>
        A much more involved than we'd expected project to install a pontoon hoist is currently in-progress. Until its complete (mid to late July) pontoon needs to be tied at end of dock. When not in-use it should be tied to dock in the same way (similar amount of slack on line, position, etc) and properly secured. Life vests are stored under the seats, please stow them between use as vests tend to blow away.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recently learned the fuel needle always indicates a full tank. Please keep this in mind before using. We've verified it's been topped-off prior to your arrvial. Our section of Black River is all sports, wake is permitted. However, as Cheboygan River is "no wake" the tachometer needs to stay around 2000 RPM to avoid a fine from sheriff. They're excited to ticket boaters and regularly have someone stopped. Assuming 2000 RPM, you can expect 5-6 hours of motor use before needing to fill up. "Anchor In" marina has a gas dock located at the confluence of Black and Cheboygan Rivers. You can get fuel there througout your stay but we request it be topped-off on your final trip prior to returning to dock. If we need to fill the tank before next guest checks in, a fee of $100USD plus cost of fuel will be added to your stay. Reciept will be provided to VRBO.

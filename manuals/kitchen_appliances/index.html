        <h2>Kitchen appliances</h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's not much to say. Standard appliances with (mostly) nothing unusual.

            <h3>Dishwasher</h3>
            <p>Dishwasher detergent pods are located under sink to left of the dishwasher.</p>
            <p>It gets HOT. To avoid melting and/or deforming plastic items - they should only be placed on top shelf.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Garbage disposal</h3>
            <p>Use disposal sparingly. Septic systems aren't able to handle what most would consider &quot;typical&quot; use. Basically, plate scrapings prior to loading dishwasher are all it can manage. Everything else should go in the trashcan.</p>

            <h3>Refrigerator (garage)</h3>
            <p>Most guests use the garage refrigerator for canned drinks or overflow from kitchen during summer months.</p>
            <p>Winter temperatures in garage are too cold for the refrigerator to function. You'll notice it's unplugged with doors open. This prevents mildew and makes getting ready for summer a breeze.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Refrigerator (kitchen)</h3>
            <p>The only notable detail is plastic drawer handles... They were an awful design and with frequent renters have cracked. As such, plans to replace the refrigerator at the end of 2022 are underway.</p>
            <p>Please be extra careful with the drawers until then.</p>

            <h3>Microwave</h3>
            <p>Another design issue: it beeps to remind you it's done - a lot... We're aware and it's days are numbered, replacing with a less annoying model end of summer.</p>

            <h3>Oven and stovetop</h3>
            <p>Hot, hot, hot.</p>
